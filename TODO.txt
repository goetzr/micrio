- Because common::Version is now a structure with a 'version' and 'download' member,
  it's serializing all this information to the version file in the index.
  We only want to serialize the 'version' member.
  Make sure it doesn't add the 'version' take to the serialized JSON.

- Running tests:
      $env:RUST_LOG = "trace"; cargo test -- --nocapture
